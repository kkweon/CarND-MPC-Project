* Project Description
The purpose of this project is to develop a model predictive controller (MPC) that can control a car in the simulation.

The program communicates with the simulator through websocket.
The car receives the following data(delayed) to control a vehicle.

- (ptsx, ptsy) :: global positions of the waypoints
- psi :: orientation of the vehicle in *radians*
- (x, y) :: global position of the vehicle
- steering_angle :: current steering angle in *randians*
- speed :: current velocity of the vehicle

* Vehicle Model
The vehicle model is a *kinematic bicycle model*.

- (x, y) :: position of the car
- psi :: heading orientation
- v :: velocity
- cte :: cross track error
- epsi :: orientation error

* Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt)

The predicted time in total is =T = N * dt=.
In this project, I chose ~N = 12~ and ~dt = 0.05~. So the time predicted was about =0.6= seconds.

Short prediction is more responsive and is also easy to lose stability.
Long prediction is more smooth in general.

I tried many possible values and found this to work the best.
Increasing =dt= leads to accurate control, but it increases the latency as well since it takes a longer to solve the problem.

* Polynomial Fitting and MPC Processing
More information can be found in [[./NOTES.org][here]]. In short, it's 3 simple steps.

** Convert global coordinates to local coordinates
Received data is in global coordinates. By global, I mean it's like longitude and latitude. We can locate it directly with the global coordinates.

However, this is a little bit complicated to use it for computations from the perspective of the car.

So, it's necessary to *transform* the perspective from global coordinates to the vehicle perspective coordinates.


It's simply done as below:

#+BEGIN_SRC C++ :exports code
  double shift_x = ptsx[i] - px;
  double shift_y = ptsy[i] - py;

  ptsx[i] = shift_x * cos(psi) + shift_y * sin(psi);
  ptsy[i] = shift_x * sin(-psi) + shift_y * cos(psi);
#+END_SRC

** Find coefficients of the fitting polynomial
Since we have points, we can find a fitting polynomial using =polyfit=.

=polyfit= is defined like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC C++ :exports code
  Eigen::VectorXd polyfit(Eigen::VectorXd xvals, Eigen::VectorXd yvals,
                          int order) {
    assert(xvals.size() == yvals.size());
    assert(order >= 1 && order <= xvals.size() - 1);
    Eigen::MatrixXd A(xvals.size(), order + 1);

    for (int i = 0; i < xvals.size(); i++) {
      A(i, 0) = 1.0;
    }

    for (int j = 0; j < xvals.size(); j++) {
      for (int i = 0; i < order; i++) {
        A(j, i + 1) = A(j, i) * xvals(j);
      }
    }

    auto Q      = A.householderQr();
    auto result = Q.solve(yvals);
    return result;
  }
#+END_SRC

** Non Linear Optimization
Now we have a state

#+BEGIN_SRC C++ :exports code
  Eigen::VectorXd state(6);
  state << 0, 0, 0, v, cte, epsi;
#+END_SRC

and coefficients from the above.

From the vehicle model, we can see the constraints and use =IPOPT= library to find optimal steering angle and acceleration.

#+BEGIN_SRC C++ :exports code
  Solution vars         = mpc.Solve(state, coeffs);
  double steer_value    = vars.deltas.at(mpc.LATENCY_IND);
  double throttle_value = vars.accs.at(mpc.LATENCY_IND);
#+END_SRC

* Model Predictive Control with latency
Also there is an =100ms= latency in the simulator, and since =100ms = 2 * dt=, first two time steps are not used in the optimization since it will be already in the past.
So, when I set the lowerbound and upperbound, I simply fix the first two values as constants. So, it does not count toward the optimization.

#+BEGIN_SRC C++ :exports code
  // Fix previous delta since it's in the past
  for (size_t i = delta_start; i < delta_start + LATENCY_IND; ++i) {
    vars_lowerbound[i] = delta_prev;
    vars_upperbound[i] = delta_prev;
  }

  for (size_t i = a_start; i < a_start + LATENCY_IND; ++i) {
    vars_lowerbound[i] = a_prev;
    vars_upperbound[i] = a_prev;
  }

* Build

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :exports code
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make && ./mpc
#+END_SRC

and run the Udacity SDC simulator.
